        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I am a dedicated second-year Software Development student at Mohawk College 
            with strong communication and problem-solving abilities. My journey into 
            software development started with a curiosity about how applications work 
            and has grown into a genuine passion for creating meaningful digital experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy building web and mobile applications that not only function well but 
            also provide intuitive and enjoyable user experiences. My approach to development 
            emphasizes writing clean, maintainable code that other developers can easily 
            understand and build upon. I believe that good software is as much about the 
            people who use it and maintain it as it is about the technology itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my studies, I've worked on various projects ranging from mobile 
            applications using React Native to solving real-world problems for small 
            businesses. Each project has taught me valuable lessons about software design, 
            debugging, and the importance of testing. I'm always eager to learn new 
            technologies and frameworks that can help me become a better developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new programming concepts, contributing 
            to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest developments 
            in the tech industry. I aim to deliver clear, maintainable work and create 
            positive experiences for both users and collaborators on every project I 
            work on.

          skills to trace problems through different system components, careful testing to 
          ensure fixes didn't introduce new issues, and clear communication with the business 
          owner to understand requirements and explain technical solutions in accessible terms.

        <p class="contact-text">
          I'm currently seeking opportunities in software development where I can apply my 
          skills, continue learning, and contribute to meaningful projects. Whether you're 
          looking for a junior developer, have questions about my work, or just want to 
          connect and discuss technology, I'd love to hear from you. I'm particularly 
          interested in roles involving web and mobile development, where I can work with 
          experienced teams and grow my expertise in building user-focused applications.
        </p>
